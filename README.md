# Generating motorbike images using LSGAN.

# Overview
In this work, the spectral normalization technique is applied to LSGANS to synthesize new motorbike color images. Results of this project might help researchers who are working on traffic recognition systems that need to recognize motorbikes, especially research in Vietnam. In fact, motorcycles are essential parts of Vietnamese daily lives because they are the main transportation vehicles there.
